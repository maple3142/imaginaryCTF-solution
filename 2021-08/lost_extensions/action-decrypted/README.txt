Dear CTFer,

Congrats on getting the key to the 7zip archive!

Assuming you retrieved the key for the last one in the intended way, 
xoring the rest of these should be easy.

Inside this archive are 10 different types of files, 
each containing a different part of the flag (You'll also be given the position of each part of the flag in order to make
it easier to piece back together). The first file you should look at is the txt file, 
which contains the beginning 6 characters of the flag. That should help you out there :)

Just a reminder - if you retrieve the keys in the correct way, 
you should be able to recover the entire key for each file. 
(keys are different lengths for each file, ranging from 2-8 characters)

Also, one of these files might be a little tough to xor back to its original because of 
something different about this specific type of file and its unusual structure. 
You'll see when you get there and it might require a little research in order to find a solution. 
(Also all keys are lowercase, you might need to alter your output for this one to make it 
lowercase if it looks like it would be the correct word) (also this file is in ISO format, it'll help later trust me)

Additionally, the audio from the mp3 file kind of cuts off at the end, 
but you're given all the characters so it shouldn't matter. If you need help deciphering it, 
open a support ticket so I can assist you there.

In addition, if you're using <REDACTED>Chef to enter xor keys, if you're not copy and pasting the keys, 
you should enter them character by character and wait for the recipe to completely finish before continuing or it will
incorrectly xor the file (especially for larger files).

Finally, if you need any help or if you think that what's supposed to work isn't working, don't hesitate to open a 
support ticket and ping me so I can assist you as soon as possible (reminder that I can't help you within the first half hour
or before the first solve - whichever comes first - unless there's a huge problem).

Good luck and happy xoring!
